# CodePortfolio
Repository for Time Series R Portfolio
 
This portfolio has a few general sections at the beginning, and then sections organized by modules (i.e. Module2, Module3, etc.).  I also added references at the bottom in APA Style, and quoted these in the text, e.g.: (Shumway & Stoffer, 2017).  

Finally, there are a few files, used in the samples, for importing data (these are also listed...in the CodePortfolio)
